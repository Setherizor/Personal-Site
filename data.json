When I look outside, I see the world full of opportunities, technology, and beauty! I actively look for problems (but I am not a pessimist), this is because I’m a doer, a maker, and a helper! <br><br> I was born in Knoxville Tennesee, on a brisk fall day (as my parents recall to me). After that, I was raised in Arkansas and Georgia, and am now loving North Carolina! I spent my youth biking with friends, walking on beaches, and adventuring. From a young age, I have been facinated by computers and their fantastical ability to enable and connect people. I have spent my time since, shooting pictures, designing websites, mocking up interfaces, taking on projects one after another, managing a website for a famiy business, gaming, and further exploring how I can enable and connect people in this amazing world."

It has given me the keys to the whole wide world and all I have needed is the desire to discover. At the core of everything I’ve done, and continue to do, is communication of all forms, technology, a will to help others, and diligence."
