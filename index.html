        I’m one of those people that is obsessed with making things better. I see every failure as a chance to learn and grow. When
        I look outside, I see the world full of opportunities, technology, and beauty! I actively look for problems (but
        I am not a pessimist), this is because I’m a doer, a maker, and a helper!
        <br><br> I was born in Knoxville Tennesee, on a brisk fall day (as my parents recall to me). After that, I was raised
        in Arkansas and Georgia, and am now loving North Carolina! I spent my youth biking with friends, walking on beaches,
        and adventuring. From a young age, I have been facinated by computers and their fantastical ability to enable and
        connect people. I have spent my time since, shooting pictures, designing websites, mocking up interfaces, taking
        on projects one after another, managing a website for a famiy business, gaming, and further exploring how I can enable
        and connect people in this amazing world.

            The Internet has connected me to people who share my passions and understand my missions. It has given me the keys to the
            whole wide world and all I have needed is the desire to discover. At the core of everything I’ve done, and continue
            to do, is communication of all forms, technology, a will to help others, and diligence.
